# Solace PubSub+ Native API Tutorials

These tutorials will guide you through the basics of getting started with Solace PubSub+ APIs.  These APIs use Solace's native SMF (Solace Message Format) protocol, vs. using another open protocol that Solace supports (e.g. MQTT, AMQP, REST).  Using the native SMF protocol allows applications to access every feature available in Solace PubSub+ event brokers.

To be able to successfully these tutorials, access to a Solace PubSub+ event broker is required.  Knowledge of Solace topics is also recommended.  For help getting started, check out this self-guided CodeLab tutorial: [A Solace Primer â€“ Getting Started with Solace PubSub+ Event Broker](https://codelabs.solace.dev/codelabs/get-started-basics).
